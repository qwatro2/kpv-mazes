# Mazes

# How to use?

## Launching the project

Launching the project (class`Main`,  method `main`)

## Selecting the size of the maze

We enter the height and width of the maze - integers, added a constraint that they must be greater than two, so that on each side there are at least three options for entering or exiting the maze

In case of incorrect input, we will see the corresponding message and will repeat the input until it becomes correct.

## Selecting a maze generation algorithm

Now we select a maze generation algorithm: Prim algorithm or Kruskal algorithm or one of them, chosen randomly

![image.png](images/image%202.png)

## Selecting a rendering method

Now we choose the rendering method: PlusMinus, built on the symbols `+` , `-` –∏ `|` , or Colorful, built on multicolored squares

![image.png](images/image%203.png)

Note: using the PlusMinus method, I can fit a maze with a width of 47 and a height of 14; using the Colorful method, I can fit a maze with a width of 30 and a height of 14.

Another note: when rendering Colorful it looks like the maze is twice as big as requested, but it's not. It's just that all the passages and lack of passages have to be drawn as a separate symbol.

## Selecting the start and end of the maze

Now we choose the beginning and the end of the maze. In order not to get confused and not to make a mistake with the cardinal directions, a ‚Äúcompass‚Äù is depicted to the right of the options.

![image.png](images/image%205.png)

![image.png](images/image%206.png)

In this example, we chose the start in the upper left corner and the end in the lower right, we get

![image.png](images/image%207.png)

The letter `A`  marks the beginning of the maze, the letter `B`  marks the end.

## Selecting a labyrinth solving algorithm

Now we choose the algorithm for solving the maze: `BFS` or `Dijkstra` or one of them chosen at random

![image.png](images/image%208.png)

And we get

![image.png](images/image%209.png)

Under the legend we see statistics - the number of good and bad passes completed

# Classes

## üóÄ Entities

### Cell

Table cell. Contains the row number, column number and cell type

### Coordinate

## üóÄ Commons

### CoordinateIndexConverter

### ParentsPathConverter

A class that encapsulates the logic of converting a list of indices into a list of coordinates according to the following principle: in the list of parent indices, we find from which index we came to the exit of the maze and write down the corresponding coordinate.
